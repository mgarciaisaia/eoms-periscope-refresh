# eoms-periscope-refresh

Proof of concept for automatically updating the URL shown in an iframe.

<>'d with â™¥ for the live chat in [Exile On Main Street site](http://eoms.org/).

## How to test

Run any HTTP server to serve this directory (ie, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) and visit `index.html`. You'll see the `iframe` change after 10 seconds.

You can change `feed-source.txt` to contain any other URL and the page will update automatically.
